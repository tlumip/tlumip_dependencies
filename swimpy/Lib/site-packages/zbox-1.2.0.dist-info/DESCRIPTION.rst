zbox is a tiny library to help me use toolz_ and cytoolz_.
I frequently use ``toolz`` and would like to use ``cytoolz`` if it's
available, but don't want to put a ``try``/``except`` in
all my projects. By importing ``toolz`` from ``zbox`` I always
get ``cytoolz`` if ``cytoolz`` is installed and otherwise I get
``toolz``.

Installation
------------

zbox is on PyPI, install it with: ``pip install zbox``.
zbox works on Python 2 and Python 3.

Usage
-----

.. code::

   from zbox import toolz

If cytoolz_ is installed ``toolz`` will be ``cytoolz``,
otherwise it will be ``toolz``.

gen
~~~

.. code::

    from zbox import gen

``gen`` is a function that converts any iterable into a Python
generator object. I use this with Pandas, which sometimes doesn't
expand iterables unless they are first converted to a generator.
