Description: PopulationSim
        =============
        
        PopulationSim is an open platform for population synthesis.  It emerged
        from Oregon DOT's desire to build a shared, open, platform that could be 
        easily adapted for statewide, regional, and urban transporation planning 
        needs.  PopulationSim is implemented in the 
        [ActivitySim](https://github.com/UDST/activitysim) framework.
